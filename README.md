# Infinite-scroll
Using the Unsplash API, we download random photos and give information about which camera was used to take the photo. Using async functions, the user doesn't realize of the new photos upload, and the vertical scroll becomes infinite. 

Clicking one image, we will access to the photo page on Unsplash.
